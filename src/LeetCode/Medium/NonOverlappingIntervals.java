/*
* Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi]
* return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
* Note that intervals which only touch at a point are non-overlapping. For example, [1, 2] and [2, 3] are non-overlapping.
    Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
